1,What is our independent variable? What is our dependent variable?

Dependent Variable: The time taken to complete the test is dependent on the type of test being taken (Congruent or Incongruent) 
this is the dependent variable.

Independent Variable: The type of test congruent or incongruent is the independent variable.

2. What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task? What kind of statistical test do you expect to perform? Justify your choices.

Null Hypothesis: The Incongruent test takes longer than the congruent test.
Alternate Hypothesis: Both the tests take the same amount of time.

I expect to perform a T test on this data, as we are only dealing with a sample and don't know mean or standard deviaion of the population.

3. Report some descriptive statistics regarding this dataset. Include at least one measure of central tendency and at least one measure of variability.
   The Mean of the Congruent test is 14.05 and standard deviation is 3.414.
   The Mean of the Incongruent test is 22.01 and the standard deviation is 4.60
   
4. Provide one or two visualizations that show the distribution of the sample data. Write one or two sentences noting what you observe about the plot or plots.
