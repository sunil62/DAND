1,What is our independent variable? What is our dependent variable?

Dependent Variable: The time taken to complete the test is dependent on the type of test being taken (Congruent or Incongruent) 
this is the dependent variable.

Independent Variable: The type of test congruent or incongruent is the independent variable.

2. What is an appropriate set of hypotheses for this task? What kind of statistical test do you expect to perform? Justify your choices.

Null Hypothesis: The Incongruent test takes longer than the congruent test.
Alternate Hypothesis: Both the tests take the same amount of time.
